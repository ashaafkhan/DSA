# Lower Bound

## Problem Description
Given a sorted array of nums and an integer x, write a program to find the lower bound of x.  
  
  
  
  
The lower bound algorithm finds the first and smallest index in a sorted array where the value at that index is greater than or equal to a given key i.e. x.  
  
  
  
  
If no such index is found, return the size of the array.  

Example 1  

Input : nums= [1,2,2,3], x = 2  
  
Output:1  
  
Explanation:  
  
Index 1 is the smallest index such that arr[1] >= x.  

Example 2  

Input : nums= [3,5,8,15,19], x = 9  
  
Output: 3  
  
Explanation:  
  
Index 3 is the smallest index such that arr[3] >= x.  

Example 3  

Input : nums= [3,5,8,15,19], x = 3  
  
Output:  
  
0  

Constraints  

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5  
  -10^5 < nums[i], x < 10^5  
  nums is sorted in ascending order.  

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution{
public:
    int lowerBound(vector<int> &nums, int x){
        //optimal
        int n = nums.size();
        int low=0,high = n-1;
        int ans = n;

        while(low<=high){
            int mid = (low+high)/2;

            if(nums[mid]>=x){
                ans = mid;
                high = mid-1;
            }else{
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
